      I'll keep it simple; I love programming and I'm proud of being a
      programmer. I enjoy the puzzles the field offers and solving them feels so
      rewarding. I will write a well designed, testable and efficient code to
      create a scalable cross-platform responsive and secure webapps from
      concepts all the way to completion; fashioning everything from the
      homepage to layout and functionalities using many modern technologies and
      tools
